# Personal Blog

## Description

I built this simple personal blog page as a means of practicing Javascript, particularly in regards to using local storage via JSON, in addition to continuing to practice the basics of HTML and CSS. Creating this project allowed me to gain experience in creating and using objects in javascript, storing those objects in arrays, and storing/retrieving those arrays as needed using the browser's local storage. Importantly, it also prompted me to practice using javascript in order to create and manipulate HTML elements - in this case, by retreiving the array of blog posts and rendering them on the webpage, as well as by creating a light/dark toggle mode! 

In short, creating this site enabled me to practice constructing a responsive site that could store and retrieve items and alter the HTML as necessary, a vital skill for web development in the industry.
